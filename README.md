# Project
- This is the initial work of the folder.
- I will provide additional sample pages which we may think later what kind of format we can use.

- Sample Pages

- http://www.hungrypiranha.org/make-a-website/html-quiz
- http://www.questionwriter.com/quiztemplates.html
- https://css-tricks.com/building-a-simple-quiz/
- i will upload more quizzes.

- I estimated that there will be three groups of people initially.
- 1) Designer who responsible for providing the different kind of format and later the designer will work as front end
- 2) Backend people
- 3) Server side people (currently we don't need it but it will be needed on later part of the project)

- I am estimating that project will be around 1-1.5 years long and no more than that.
